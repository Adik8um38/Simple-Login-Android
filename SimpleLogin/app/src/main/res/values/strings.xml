    <string name="app_short_description">SimpleLogin is a open source solution to protect your online identity.\n\nSimpleLogin strives to offer a simple experience for both users and partners/developers</string>
    <string name="step_1">The next time a website asks for your email address, just create a new alias instead of using your real email.</string>
    <string name="step_2">All emails sent to an alias are forwarded to your \"real\" email address without the sender knowing anything.</string>
    <string name="step_3">On your desktop, you can install our browser extension to manage and quickly create aliases on the fly.\n\nOn your smartphone with SimpleLogin installed, whenever you need to register to a website, simply \"share\" the website you are visiting with SimpleLogin to quickly create an alias.</string>
    <string name="what_a">Subscribe to mailing lists, create new online accounts with email alias.\n\nAll emails sent to an alias will be <b>forwarded</b> to your personal inbox.\n\nLater on, simply block an alias if it\'s too spammy.</string>
    <string name="what_b">Just hit \"Reply\" whenever you need to reply to a forwarded email: the reply will come from the alias and your personal mailbox stays hidden.\n\nYou can also <u>send</u> emails to any email address from your alias.</string>
    <string name="what_c">Use alias as your <b>business email</b>.\n\nSave $6/month for each business email created with SimpleLogin.\n\nBy the way your company emails are actually aliases.</string>
    <string name="forgot_password_message">For security reason and to avoid database leak, all \"forgot password\" requests are taken into account silently without you being informed if a request is successful or not.\n\nSo make sure that you enter the correct email address.</string>
    <string name="create_alias_hint">üí°Hint: To make it easy to remember for later use, it is a good practice to use the name of the website/service that you plan to register with alias.</string>
    <string name="create_alias_warning">‚ö†Ô∏è Only letters, numbers, dash (-) &amp; underscore (_) are allowed.</string>
    <string name="api_key_explanation">To get your API key, you must sign in SimpleLogin by using a browser, then navigate to \"API Key\" tab, create one if not already then copy and paste the key here.</string>
    <string name="do_not_change_api_url"><b>DO NOT</b> change API URL unless you are hosting SimpleLogin with your own server.</string>
    <string name="default_api_url">The default value is <b>https://app.simplelogin.io</b></string>
